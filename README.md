### RENT-A-RIDE

Welcome to rent-a-ride, a website including a administration dashboard using the Laravel framework.
We created this project so people can contribute and learn the Laravel framework, from beginners to more advanced users.

## Rules
1. DO NOT push directly into the main branch, for each feature create a branch and do a pull request with @JessedeB as reviewer
2. Don't start of a new feature instantly, discuss this with @JessedeB
3. Work with eachother, not against eachother.
4. DO NOT accept incomming pull request, only @JessedeB is allowed to do this.
5. DO NOT comment someone else's feature without discussing this with @JessedeB
6. DO NOT delete files or code without permission from @JessedeB
7. DO NOT change the project structure without discussing this with @JessedeB

If any of the above rules are broken, you will be kicked out of the team and won't be able to participate in any other project.
