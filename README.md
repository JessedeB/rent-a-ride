### RENT-A-RIDE

Welcome to rent-a-ride, a website including a administration dashboard using the Laravel framework.
We created this project so people can contribute and learn the Laravel framework, from beginners to more advanced users.

# Getting a dev environment running with sail
You will need composer and docker installed and setup before starting

1. Clone the repo into a new folder
2. copy and paste '.env.example' to '.env'; 
   1. make any necessary changes see https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sail#debugging-with-xdebug if you are running linux
3. run 'composer install'
4. run './vendor/bin/sail up' in windows this has to be run from wsl
5. run 'php artisan key:generate'
6. run 'php artisan migrate --seed'

# Projects tab
Within the projects tab above, a simple kanban board is shown. Within this board, you'll see the current state of the project.
ONLY pick new items when your current one has been completed and approved by @JessedeB.
ONLY add new items to the list in coordination with @JessedeB
IF an item is already open for a while, contact the group ( or @JessedeB ) if you can pick up the item.

## Rules
1. DO NOT push directly into the main branch, for each feature create a branch and do a pull request with @JessedeB as reviewer
2. Don't start of a new feature instantly, discuss this with @JessedeB
3. Work with eachother, not against eachother.
4. DO NOT accept incomming pull request, only @JessedeB is allowed to do this.
5. DO NOT comment someone else's feature without discussing this with @JessedeB
6. DO NOT delete files or code without permission from @JessedeB
7. DO NOT change the project structure without discussing this with @JessedeB
